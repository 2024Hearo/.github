Overview
---
It provides chatting without language barriers to hearing impaired people, and shows helpful sounds in emergency situations.

 "Hearo" combines the words **"Heard" + "Hero,"** symbolizing **"being the voice and ears of individuals with hearing impairments."** Heroes act as personal sign language interpreters for individuals with hearing impairments, assisting in smooth communication and free expression. It provides chatting without language barriers to hearing impaired people, and provides helpful sounds in emergency situations.
 
### Background
"Poor health management, low economic participation, educational achievement", "Risk of depression", "Technological vulnerability"

 69.3% of the hearing-impaired use sign language as their first language, and they are referred to as 'hearing-impaired'. In society, there is a shortage of services provided with sign language and people who can sign. Hearing-impaired communicate in daily life through sign language interpreters, but there is a shortage of interpreters, and it incurs costs. Consequently, the hearing-impaired experience **language barriers in communication**, with 54% of them responding that they find it difficult to communicate in daily life. They encounter social barriers due to constraints on accessibility in all areas of life such as medical care, purchasing goods, employment, education, and culture. Moreover, in emergencies, expressing themselves rapidly in sign language is difficult, and there are few people who understand and can help them, putting them at risk. These issues restrict their activities, leading to economic difficulties and healthcare management problems.

 Additionally, individuals with hearing impairments are at a **higher risk of experiencing depression**. There are reports on the association between hearing impairment and depression, with the likelihood of experiencing depression being about 50% higher than in non-disabled individuals. Language barriers affect social functioning, leading to depression, anxiety, and interpersonal relationship problems.

 They are also **marginalized in technological advancement**. Congenital hearing-impaired have language disorders because they have not been exposed to speech. According to statistics, the illiteracy rate among individuals with hearing impairments is about 30%, making it difficult for them to use services such as AI Chat and SMS that rely on text. They also face difficulties in using services such as telephone counseling provided in spoken language.

 Therefore, our service aims to address the issues of communication and technological discrimination. Rather than demanding the hearing-impaired become like us through 'Hearo', we seek to respect them and ensure opportunities for fair social participation.

 ### Target & Goal
 The main target is hearing-impaired people (who use sign language as their main language), and the sub-target is people who want to communicate with hearing-impaired.

 The service objectives are **"Communication," "Experience," "Equality."** We aim to achieve linguistic equality by overcoming communication barriers for individuals with hearing impairments, ensuring their fundamental rights by enabling their free expression. We will provide various experiences, such as using technology, through linguistic equality. Ultimately, our goal is to narrow the gap between non-disabled individuals and individuals with disabilities, aiming to provide a society without discrimination and with equal opportunities.

Through chatting, we solve communication issues between individuals with hearing impairments and non-disabled individuals. We recognize sign language and convert it into text and voice, and also convert text written by non-disabled individuals into sign language to facilitate mutual communication.

 We provide a feature to convert between sign language and text, enabling individuals with hearing impairments to use Gemini as well.

 Voice support resolves the difficulties faced by non-speaking individuals with hearing impairments. Instead of sign language, commonly used phrases and requests needed in emergency situations can be expressed in voice. Additionally, alarms have been added to homes for improved accessibility.

 It analyzes the voice and provides the characteristics visually. Hearing impairments who have never heard their voice can experience recognizing the characteristics of their voice. It provides voice reports such as energy and rhythm.

Expected effects
---
Through Hearo, we wanted to minimize the technical and linguistic discrimination that hearing-impaired people have faced, and the expected effects of Hero are as follows.
Available for emergency situations with voice alarm

**Two chat functions allow communication on a variety of topics**

By breaking down the communication barrier between hearing impaired and non-disabled people through general chatting, social isolation and depression that can occur due to lack of communication are resolved.
Through chatting with artificial intelligence Gemini, you can learn the latest information and knowledge that you were unable to receive due to technical differences.

**Available for emergency situations with voice alarm**

Voices frequently used in emergency situations have been added to the home screen, allowing you to quickly call for help and safely escape the emergency situation.
Users can also add frequently used notifications later, allowing them to create their own emergency notifications.

**Visualization of Voice**

This is a basic function that can be used not only by the hearing impaired but also by all users who use Hearo. You can see your voice visually through Hearo.


Hearo will ultimately ensure autonomy in communication for the hearing impaired and prevent them from becoming socially isolated.
